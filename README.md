☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Using Excel

💡 In this project, I analyzed the sales data of a coffee shop using Excel to uncover insights and trends that can help improve business performance. 
By leveraging various Excel features such as pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, I provided actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies.

🧐 The coffee shop was facing challenges in understanding the sales patterns and customer behavior. They had data, but it was scattered and not being fully utilized to make data-driven decisions. The management team needed a way to quickly analyze the sales data and gain insights that could help increase revenue and customer satisfaction and improve inventory management.

🎯 The task was to clean, organize, and analyze the coffee shop’s sales data in Excel to:
Identify sales trends (e.g., peak hours, best-selling products).
Spot opportunities for inventory optimization and promotional strategies.
Present the analysis in a way that could inform future business decisions.

🛠️ To complete the task, I took the following actions:
Data Cleaning: I cleaned the raw sales data by removing any duplicate entries, handling missing values, and ensuring the data was in a consistent format.
Data Organization: I structured the data into meaningful categories, such as products, sales dates, and sales amounts, using Excel tables for better organization and efficiency.
Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to summarize sales by product, day, and time, enabling easy identification of sales trends.
Charts & Graphs: Visualized the sales data using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent the best-selling products, peak sales hours, and monthly trends.
Conditional Formatting: Applied conditional formatting to highlight high and low sales, making the data more accessible and easier to interpret.
Insights & Recommendations: Based on the analysis, I made actionable recommendations on how the coffee shop could improve sales during off-peak hours and optimize inventory.

🎉 The analysis provided valuable insights into the coffee shop’s sales performance:
Identified peak sales hours and most popular products.
Helped the management team make informed decisions on inventory management and product offerings.

The results of the analysis were presented in an easy-to-understand format, allowing for quick implementation of changes.
